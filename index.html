            <h1 id="s3h1">Web Development</h1>
            <p id="s3p">Web development is the work involved in developing a web site for 
               the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).
               Web development can range from developing a simple single static
               page of plain text to complex web-based internet applications 
               (web apps), electronic businesses, and social network services. 
               A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development 
               commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web 
               content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side s
               cripting, web server and network security configuration, and 
               e-commerce development.

                Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the
                main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and 
                coding. Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to 
                make content changes easier and available with basic technical 
                skills.
                    
                For larger organizations and businesses, web development teams can 
                consist of hundreds of people (web developers) and follow standard 
                methods like Agile methodologies while developing websites. Smaller 
                organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting 
                developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such 
                as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web 
                development may be a collaborative effort between departments 
                rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three
                kinds of web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end
                developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers responsible 
                for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end
                developers deal with the servers.
            </p>
            <p id="s3p2">
                    Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a 
                    growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by 
                    businesses wishing to use their website to advertise and sell products
                     and services to customers.

                    There are many open source tools for web development such as BerkeleyDB, 
                    GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This 
                    has kept the cost of learning web development to a minimum. Another
                     contributing factor to the growth of the industry has been the rise of
                      easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software, such as Adobe 
                      Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio. Knowledge of 
                      HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming languages is still 
                      required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and 
                      implemented quickly.
                    
                    An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers 
                    build more dynamic and interactive websites. Further, web developers 
                    now help to deliver applications as web services which were traditionally
                     only available as applications on a desk-based computer. This has allowed 
                     for many opportunities to decentralize information and media distribution.
                      Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative 
                      Cloud, Dropbox and Google Drive. These web services allow users to interact 
                      with applications from many locations, instead of being tied to a specific
                       workstation for their application environment.
                    
                    Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led by web 
                    development include e-commerce. Online auction sites such as eBay have 
                    changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and services. Online 
                    retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among many others) have 
                    transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting experience for many consumers.
                     Another example of transformative communication led by web development is 
                     the blog. Web applications such as WordPress and Movable Type have created
                      blog-environments for individual websites. The increased usage of 
                      open-source content management systems and enterprise content management
                       systems has extended web development's impact at online interaction and
                        communication.
                    
                    Web development has also impacted personal networking and marketing.
                     Websites are no longer simply tools for work or for commerce, but serve
                      more broadly for communication and social networking. Web sites such as
                       Facebook and Twitter provide users with a platform to communicate and
                        organizations with a more personal and interactive way to engage the 
                        public.
